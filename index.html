          <p class="description"> Tardigrades are microscopic organisms renowned for their ability to survive in extreme conditions. 
          Recent studies have highlighted their ability to adapt and survive in space, making them a key focus for future space exploration.
          This article delves into the significance of tardigrades in space research, including experiments conducted in space, 
          their biological mechanism, and how recent studies behind the unique adaptations of tardigrades can contribute to further 
          develop human space exploration.

         <p class="text">Discovered in 1773, tardigrades, commonly known as water bears, are small invertebrates ranging 
        from 0.5mm to 1mm in size. Their molecular mechanism allows them to survive in some of the harshest conditions, 
        such as: extreme temperatures, extreme pressure, radiation, dehydration and starvation, allowing them 
        to inhabit diverse environments from the depths of the sea to the top of the highest mountain (Robertson, 2022).

    <h2>Missions to space</h2>
    <h3>FOTON-M3 (2007)</h3> 
    <p>In September 2007, the ESA (European Space Agency) sent 3000 tardigrades into space for 12 days. 
     In the vacuum of space, some of the tardigrades were exposed to: UV-A and UV-B radiation, others were exposed to the entire UV spectrum.
     Although all the tardigrades exposed to the whole spectrum died, 68% of them survived (Rebecchi, 2011). </p>
       
     <h3>Cell Science 04 (CS-04)</h3>
     <p>In June 2021, tardigrades were sent to the ISS to further explore their biological characteristics. This experiment was conducted to 
     identify the genes needed for tardigrades to survive in extreme conditions and how these genes change over different generations. Results from this experiment 
     provide a greater understanding of how tardigrades can endure spaceflight and how this could aid astronauts in the future (Imster, 2021). </p>
       
     <h3>Phobos Life Project</h3>
     <p>This project aimed to examine how the water bears can live through space flight conditions. 
     The organisms used included three different species of tardigrades which were all radiation resistant. 
     However, the project was unsuccessful due to the spacecraft, which contained the equipment, crashing.</p>
   
     <h2>Biological Mechanisms</h2>
     <h3>Anhydrobiosis</h3>
     <p>Anhydrobiosis is a form of cryptobiosis in which the tardigrades can enter a tun state, tolerating radiation, the vacuum of space, 
     high pressures and temperatures. In this cryptobiotic state, these tiny organisms can cease their metabolic processes, preventing reproduction, 
     development and maintaining their cellular structure. Trehalose, a type of sugar, is known to tolerate desiccation and helps tardigrades function in 
     extreme environments. In this state, they can survive:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Extreme temperatures: -272.95 to 150 degrees Celsius</li>	                                                         
        <li>High pressure: 40,000 kilopascals</li>	   
        <li>UV radiation from space</li>	
      </ul>
      <h3>DNA repair</h3>
      <p>The tardigrades’ cellular mechanism allows them to repair DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, although it isn’t exactly known how they possess this ability.
      Anoud et al. found a gene unique to them known as TDR1 (see fig.1). Researchers exposed a new species of tardigrades to radiation and found 2801 genes related to DNA repair 
      were active. With further research, it was discovered that TDR1 can bind to DNA and minimise any damage (Miller, 2011).</p>
             /* insert image (fig.1)*/
      <h3>Tun state</h3> 
      <p>In order to survive such harsh conditions, tardigrades must enter the tun state, this reaction is triggered by the oxidation of cysteine which is an amino acid. 
      In this state, the water bears lose up to 99% of their body moisture and undergo cryptobiosis, allowing them to live for more than 30 years without water. Water bears produce 
      unique proteins depending on their hydration level, when hydrated the proteins are unstructured but when dehydrated, the proteins form a glasslike solid which protects other 
      proteins, preventing them breaking down. Boothby’s collaborators also discovered that “Yeast engineered to produce the tardigrade glass proteins survive desiccation better than 
      they normally do”, which could be used to enhance methods used to protect biological material such as tissue and cells (Boothby et al., 2021).</p>
      
       <h2>Future exploration</h2>
       <p>Understanding the tardigrades’ ability to adapt and survive could have a massive impact on the future of space exploration. By examining the biological characteristics of these 
       unique creatures and the mechanisms behind their resistance to extreme temperatures, high pressures and radiation, scientists could be able to develop their technology to benefit 
       astronauts and keep them protected from extreme conditions and the effects of space travel such as microgravity . When discussing the Cell Science-04 experiment, 
       Thomas Boothby states, “by understanding how these tough little organisms are able to survive spaceflight conditions, … give us hints and clues into, you know, how we might 
       safeguard astronauts during prolonged space missions”, highlighting the significance of tardigrades in spaceflight (Imster, 2021).</p>
          
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>With there amazing abilities to adapt to such conditions, the tenacity of tardigrades raises intriguing questions about life beyond Earth and the possibility of different 
        organisms existing in other extreme environments in the universe. Despite their microscopic size, they remain as one of the strongest animals in the world, making them incredibly significant 
        creatures for research into the mechanisms of survival in extremophiles. Understanding these adaptations could provide groundbreaking developments in fields like medicine, biotechnology, and 
        even astrobiology.</p>
